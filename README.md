## Timeline

5/11 work on adding more levels to my game - include 3 levels; debug any issues

5/12 starts creating a different speed for how fast each “enemy” - “rain drops” will be dropped for each level. Starting slow in level 1 and then the speed will accelerate within the next levels.


5/14 add any additional functions that would allow the game to be properly played, such as additional coding.


5/15 Clean up code for the repository and add any elements( texts, colors, etc.) that would suit the game - especially for the “title”, “tutorial”, “You Win”, and “game over” pages.  

5/17 Change the score system either keep it as is or change it to “time frame score”

5/19 debug any faulties, also ask for a second opinion from others to see if their should be any changes to the code

5/20 reorganize code once more and clean up or remove any unnecessary coding. Also center all functions including for how the game will appear
